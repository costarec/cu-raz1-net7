Contoso tutorial using Razor &amp; net7
### Dykstra Contoso Tutorial w/Razor Pages using dotnet7 - Part 1
- This repos is being created for students registered in TINFO-431 Server Side Web Applications at UW Tacoma Winter 2023
- It works correctly with the Tom Dykstra/Rick Anderson tutorial published at:

(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio)

- dotnet7 version of the tutorial requires the following nuget packages:
  - Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
  - Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore
  - Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

  - The EF issues dealing with nullable types have been addressed as noted in the part 1 steps, changing the .csproj file and Grade in the Enrollment class, but there could be more - I'm not completely clear on this issue - still reading about it.
#### The remaining parts of the Dykstra/Razor version of the tutorial will be coming soon...
